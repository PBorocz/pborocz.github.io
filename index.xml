      <description>While not an accountant, I believe I can distinguish between cash vs. accrual accounting, pertinently:
 Accrual accounting recognises either the obligation or intent of the government to spend money (or the converse) on a planned basis. Cash accounting tracks the actual cash movements.  [Please correct me if there&amp;rsquo;s anything pertinently wrong about this characterisation!]
From this, we can distinguish several salient points:
Legislative Spending is an Accrual Basis Concept Legislation that stipulates (future) spending should be treated on an accrual basis, programs may not ramp up as quickly as planned, future legislation might pull the spending back etc.</description>

      <description>What is it? When combining more than one new resource with another one. Resources could be almost anything, i.e. people, technology, processes etc.
What are some examples?  Pairing a brand new technology stack on a brand-new project (particularly without adequate risk-management). Pairing a newly-hired employee under a newly-hired supervisor/manager. Pairing a brand new project manager onto a new, high-risk project.  Suggestions? As a risk manager, I always suggest never getting into the New on New scenario.</description>
